I believe the most important initiative is maintaining and regularly updating the SMP website. It’s essential that the website offers a smooth user interface and an overall great user experience. From my experience, React is an excellent and easy-to-use library for building such interfaces. The previous website was likely built using PHP, which is not typically preferred nowadays for creating highly user-friendly websites.

Another significant initiative is the Unified DAMP Blogs project. This effort aims to merge the separate DAMP Blogs maintained by eleven different departments-currently hosted on WordPress or GitHub-into a single, feature-rich platform hosted on Gymkhana servers. This consolidation reduces redundancy, centralizes course reviews, and encourages better collaboration and input from all departments. Impressively, ten out of the eleven departments have already approved this move.

The Chemistry DAMP Blogs served as the starting point for this unification. By first creating the Chemistry DAMP Blogs, it became straightforward to extend the platform to other departments by adding a few components to the frontend code. Since the CSS styling was already prepared for Chemistry, replicating it for other departments was relatively easy.

I also really appreciate the ISMP and DAMP peer review initiative. Instead of circulating multiple forms, having a centralized platform-our website-streamlines the feedback process. Only those genuinely interested or with meaningful feedback about their mentors would participate, making the reviews more valuable to stakeholders like students and professors. While having separate buttons for ISMP and DAMP is useful, I think this could be enhanced by listing mentors and enabling voting. Mentors who receive more positive reviews and votes could be featured on the website, fostering healthy competition and encouraging excellence.

Lastly, the Mentor-Mentee Logs initiative is a great idea. If I had the chance to contribute, I would suggest incorporating features like attendance tracking and meeting reviews. Although it might feel overwhelming initially, it would help maintain consistent communication beyond regular meetings. To make it more engaging, we could introduce fun elements-for example, rewarding mentors who give the most “treats” (recognitions or rewards) with opportunities to be featured on the site. Small incentives like these can motivate mentors to strive for excellence.
